# 🧬 Simple Linear Regression – Biological Experiment Analysis


## ✅ Introduction
This project analyzes a biological experiment where the relationship between two quantitative variables was explored using simple linear regression — one of the most fundamental statistical techniques taught in the early stages of data analysis and biostatistics education.

While conceptually simple, this model provides a strong foundation for interpreting biological relationships with clarity and precision.
